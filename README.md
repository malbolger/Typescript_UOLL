# Scripts
## [Bandage The World](https://github.com/malbolger/Typescript_UOLL/blob/main/Bandage_The_World)

## [Semi-Auto Taming](https://github.com/malbolger/Typescript_UOLL/blob/main/Semi-Auto_Taming)
Full auto feel too icky? With this version, you press the hoykey, select your target and the script will follow and keep taming until success!
## [Bard Trainer](https://github.com/malbolger/Typescript_UOLL/blob/main/Bard_Trainer)
So far this will work for Peacemanking, Provocation and Musicianship. Just set the bools to 'true' for the ones you want to train.
## [Weight Tracker](https://github.com/malbolger/Typescript_UOLL/blob/main/Weight_Tracker)
Convient overhead everytime your weight changes with colors to warn you.( [Current Weight / Max Weight] )
## [Sheep Barber](https://github.com/malbolger/Typescript_UOLL/blob/main/Sheep_Barber)
Will walk to all sheep with wool on the screen and sheer them one at a time. (USING THIS AFK IS ILLEGAL!)
## [Spin n Loom](https://github.com/malbolger/Typescript_UOLL/blob/main/Spin_n_Loom)
Will turn all of that hard earned wool into yarn and then cloth at your local tailor shop!
## [Hiding and Stealth Trainer](https://github.com/malbolger/Typescript_UOLL/blob/main/Hiding_Stealth_Trainer)
Will train hiding and if you want when you reach 80 hiding it will start training stealth too! (Not tested yet!)
## [Lockpick Trainer](https://github.com/malbolger/Typescript_UOLL/blob/main/Lockpick_Trainer)
Just target your practice box, the key, and make sure you got lockpicks in your bag.
## [Move All Container-2-Container](https://github.com/malbolger/Typescript_UOLL/blob/main/Move_All_Container-2-Container)
Select the source container and then the destination container. This will move every item from one to another. Great for quickly offloading loot to an unsorted loot container and getting you quickly back to the hunt!
## [Move All Type](https://github.com/malbolger/Typescript_UOLL/blob/main/Move_All_Type)
Move all of the targeted type to a destination container. This works great to clean up your crafting mess into a trash bin!
